# Click to Edit

This example explores a click-to-edit page.
It uses [sqlc](https://sqlc.dev) and SQLite for database interactions.
It differs from the [htmx example](https://htmx.org/examples/click-to-edit/) in its use of hx-boost.

To run this make sure you have sqlite3 in your path and then just run 'go run .' in this directory.
You can then navigate to http://localhost:8080.
